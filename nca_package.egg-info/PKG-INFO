# Network-Component-Analysis

An implementation of the Network Component Analysis from Liao & al : http://www.pnas.org/content/100/26/15522.abstract

## Installation

```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage

```python
import numpy as np
from nca.nca import NCA

# Create a dummy Z matrix (connectivity matrix)
Z = np.zeros((5, 3))
Z[0, 0] = 1
Z[1, 0] = 1
Z[2, 1] = 1
Z[3, 1] = 1
Z[4, 2] = 1

# Create a dummy P matrix (transcription factor activities)
P = np.random.rand(3, 10)

# Create some dummy expression data
E = np.random.rand(5, 10)

# Create an NCA object
nca = NCA(Z=Z, P=P)

# Train the model
nca.train(E, num_it=5)

# Get the results
A = nca.A
P_optimized = nca.P
```
